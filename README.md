# Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908
Project Description
This repository provides an analysis of airplane crashes with a focus on various aspects of incidents and trends. The analysis includes the following points:

Yearly Statistics: Determine the number of plane crashes each year, the total number of people on board, the number of survivors, and the number of fatalities.
Operator and Aircraft Type Analysis: Identify the operator with the highest number of crashes and the types of aircraft involved in these incidents.
Crash Summary Analysis: The ‘Summary’ field contains details about each crash. Analyze and categorize the reasons for crashes into clusters such as:
Fire
Shot down
Weather
UNKNOWN (for missing data)
Additional clusters may be created but should not exceed a total of 7.
Categorical Analysis: Calculate the number of crashed aircraft and the number of deaths for each crash category identified in the previous step.
Trend Analysis: Explore and identify any interesting trends or behaviors observed from the dataset.
